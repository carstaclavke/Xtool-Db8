# Xtool Db8
  
Hi Kevin. I am also having that problem and also my design looks perfect on the computer but when I send it to the laser, it burns it like mirror, that is somewhat inverted. I hope I can explain my self and hopefully someone will give us some thought on these problems. By the way I am running Lightburn in a MacBookPro TB M1 with Monterrey . I mention these because I had this inversion problem in another software and the culprit was the MacOS very much to my surprise.

I downloaded the driver as suggested and everything is now working properly. I hope it helps you too. Forget about my comento on the MacOS as it was obviously a problem with the driver and that has been solved. Good luck to you and happy lasering!!!
 
Trying to load the .lbdev file. I tried to load it hooked up to the D1. Went to device, xtool, then tried to import. It would not let me. I deleted xtools and reloaded it samething happened. I am kind of at a lost how to load the above file. it will not highlight or give me an option to run it. Thank you
 
Thank you. I did all you asked. It still will not load. I rebooted after I created the new file. I am sure it is something simple. I am going to step back for a moment and regroup later on. I appreciate all the information and your assistance.

Thanks PY. I downloaded it to my work computer put it on a thumb drive and loaded it that way. A couple of little hiccups. deleted and reloaded and it seems to be working correctly now. Thank you for your insights and patience with this old codger. Now my RA2 just showed up LOL
 
I have to put all the texts or words in a mirror so that I can engrave or cut them in the normal way and THIS IS ALREADY A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE I have to do everything twice and it makes me lose money and time
 
Thank you for contacting us!
According to your description, if the engraved picture is offset, you can send us the picture of your work to locate the problem. Please also attach your PC firmware version information. ( Our after-sales team: support@xtool.com )
 
We also just got this machine (5w) and are experiencing the same problem. It gets part way into a bidirectional raster scan, then starts stuttering, with the imaging shifting slightly to the right each time. This occurs in a repeatable manner. It starts at the same time on the image, although the start position changes if you change the speed, appearing earlier at higher speeds. We contacted support, with a copy of the file and pictures of the result, and are awaiting a response. Did you ever get any resolution to the problem?
 
Having a problem with my D1 pro 20 watt. x tool laser. When i try to engrave a large item over 180 setting speed no matter the power it starts to hesitate and click and does not want to work properly. The test pattern for what i am trying to run tells me to run at 375 at 30 percent power and i can not do that at all. When it is making the test pattern it has no problem. I know i have engraved large wood items before and had no issues even though this is not wood. So i am almost thinking this is a firm ware update issue or a software issue. belts are tight and everything is lubed so i am at a lost. love the machine i have finally figured out alot of other things lately on it to run but now this is happening please help.i also have checked couplings too. i took the laser off the slide and it still does it with the laser on the board only going side to side.

In addition to the Print Gocco model that was available in the USA, I lugged a fancier model back from Japan that has a better registration system. It would be fun to get more use out of that. I do still have exposed screens I made for it and, a handful of unexposed screens. I am not optimistic those are still good at this point, though.
 
I got mine just before the new year, and basically settled on 1000/70/270. I ran from 10-65 power at 5 power increments before I got there. I spent some time looking at the xtool guides before I just finally started lower and increased, every time, taking it out and looking at it through the light until there were no artifacts. The tshirt I printed looked really pretty good for a first attempt.
